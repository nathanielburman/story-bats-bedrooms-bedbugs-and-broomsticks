# story-bats-bedrooms-bedbugs-and-broomsticks
Bats, Bedrooms, Bedbugs &amp; Broomsticks. Smoking is a form of rocket science. 

The field of bats waere eating all insects alive. The field of rats were eating each other alive. The bugs inside the room dirty the room dirty the room dirty. bedbugs inside the room dirty the room dirty the room black and grimey, grimey, grimey.

When reading the end of the above, be aware that the second time you say grimey or at some point in realizing that it is just repeating itself three times there is some motion to look away, even right now there is motion to look away. I would look away from these words if I were you right now. Look away, look away, why is she still looking...
